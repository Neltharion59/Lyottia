But there is this shadow on my mind...I cannot find peace until that necromancer is stopped. You will be headed that way, right? If you do not mind, could I come with you? This place has bestowed gifts upon me. I have vast knowledge of magic now, knowledge that could help you in your journey. All I ask is that we stop that necromancer  together...and all his creations too.";
