A base that has been resisting the foul magic of liches and lithids since its blueprints were first drawn. A base that consumed large part of goblin society for too long. And the purpose? To surprise the human and dwarven kingdoms with a devastating attack? To conquer the land? What good would that bring? It wouldn't bring any good even to us, goblins. We're the happiest when we're constructing new inventions and exploding with them. We need to remember that. And I will make sure that Cagoblia does not forget it again for a long time. But you don't have time to spare. We have our machinery to carry us to safety quickly, but you need to walk on foot. And it won't be long until the dark wizardry creatures of this swarm pounce at this place. Let me accompany you to the exit.";
