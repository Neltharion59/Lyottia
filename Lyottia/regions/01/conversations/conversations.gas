It would not be safe for me neither for you if I told you. Let us focus on you. I wonder why is one so able-bodied and sharp-minded hiding themself from the world in the middle of nowhere?\n\nYou are too humble. I spoke with a lot of people on my travels, and very few had such fire in their eyes. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? You have thought of it many times, I'm sure. So why the hesitation? Really, nothing stops you from grabbing the few things you own and seeking your luck in the world.\n\nHow about you begin by visiting the town? All adventurers need to buy their starting equipment somewhere. You do not need to worry about gold - I have seen the kinds of creatures that lurk around here. You will fight a fair amount of them, and more than a few will carry valuable possessions on them. Trust me, you will be a new person once you reach the town.\n\nYou want me to travel with you? You flatter me with your interest, but I prefer travelling alone. You may find a companion for your journey nearby, however. I have seen a man unpacking a tent on my way here. Do hurry thought, as I do not think the trolls will leave him alone for long.\n\nIf you do not mind, I'll help myself to your bed for a short while, then I will see where the road takes me. Do not worry. I will leave your house and your toolshed intact. Good luck, young adventurer. May we meet again, so that I get to see you become a proper warrior.";
