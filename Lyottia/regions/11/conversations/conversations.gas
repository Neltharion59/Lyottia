If I was surprised when you reached Meadow Steps, what am I now? Amazed, at least. Should I have helped you? And what if you fell? I would be fighting that moster without someone to keep his undead army away from me. I may be good, but I'm not that good. I haven't survived this long by picking the fights I cannot win. I am going my own way with my own reasons. I know you are on your noble quest to help to remove the blockade, taking you a longer route than you expected. And it's gonna be even longer. This is the only route you can take, yet it is the worst one you could take. These lands are full of darkness and you will need every ounce of strength you can find.";
