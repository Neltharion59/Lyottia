And it's gonna be even longer. See, not all villagers have been risen as undead by the necromancer. A group of heroes, much like yours, happened to be visiting the village when the necromancer appeared. They managed to flee with most of the villagers and their possessions. I helped them keep the necromancer busy by the way, should you suspect that I never liftted a finger to help them. This was the only route they could have taken, yet it was the worst one they have taken. These lands are full of darkness and even two adventuring parties will have to use every ounce of their strength to stay alive and protect the refugees.";
