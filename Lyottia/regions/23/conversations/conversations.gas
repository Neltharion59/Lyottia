Nothing really grows in these mountains, so they probably do not even realize our crops are food, as they have never seen anything alike. The danger is that they eventually realize what it is and destroy them. We do not depend on the crops, it is not possible to grow the amount we would need in these parts. But they make fine addition to the dull diet of monster meat and questionable bread made of bones and tiny sickly foliage of the Bellowing Highland.
