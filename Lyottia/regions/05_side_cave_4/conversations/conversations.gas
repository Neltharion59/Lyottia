Our voyage eventually ended, but our friendship did not. We began to travel the lands, helping those in need and serving those who could afford our swords. Life was great, until these krug ambushed us in our sleep. Kimmazan fell asleep on his watch, so we were an easy target. I can't say I blame him, it could happen to anyone. We are not machines. Anyway, few of us ran into this cavern. Unarmed and off guard, everyone but me was killed by those foul tentacles. Now, alone, with bodies of my dead friends and foul creatures as company, I am on the verge of giving up on this fight called life. Bah, what would Tanaya say if she saw me pitying myself like this?";
