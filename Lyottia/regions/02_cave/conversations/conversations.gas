The staff may be unstable however, so I prepared a protection spell. Should too much fire energy emerge, my spell with seal the staff in stone altar. Stone can be broken of course, but it should be enough to keep the staff's energy at bay. If something goes wrong, I hope someone will find this note and carry on with my research. The staff would be the key.";
