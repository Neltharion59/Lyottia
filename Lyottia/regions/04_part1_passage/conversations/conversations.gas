You see, I was practising teleportation and as soon as I uttered the formula, I ended up here. I must have miscalculated somehow. Now I'm trying to get home. I'd travel with you, I don't think those vermin-infested caves are suited for me. I'm regenerating my mana right now, so that I can try to teleport myself back. Well, I know it's likely to go wrong again, but I'm sure sooner or later I must end up near the Theravian academy, where I started. There's no better learning than the hard way, huh? But I think I can help you in other way. You see, apart from being an apprentice mage, I am also a merchant. Perhaps we could exchange a few items, what do you think?";

Whatever lives in those caves, we can surely repel it more efficiently if we work together.";
