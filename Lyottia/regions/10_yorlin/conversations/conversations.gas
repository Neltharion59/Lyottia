It's almost as if he guided me here. But he refuses to say anything, the foxy fellow. I was ready to take my life away in desperation when I got here. Everyone I knew is dead, everything I love is destroyed. Why should I live? But this place....it sooths my soul. It eases pain. It makes you...love life. But there is this shadow on my mind...I cannot find peace until that necromancer is stopped. You will be headed that way, right? If you do not mind, could I come with you? This place has bestowed gifts upon me. I have vast knowledge of magic now, knowledge that could help you in your journey. All I ask is that we stop that necromancer  together...and all his creations too.";

It is rather unusual for someone to wander into my house. And now I have two travelers at once. Poor Rinnilea arrived two weeks ago. It would seem that there's a mighty necromancer residing in her village. She is probably the only one that survived his visit. He even tried to reach out to my house with his foul powers - you wouldn't believe how foul - but my magic was strong enough to repel him. My power is bound to this place. I can provide shelter to anyone againts any dark might, but I cannot leave my house and fight him. But my story is not important. What matters, is what lies ahead of you. No, I will not tell you. What fun would that be? But I may offer you what I offer to all travelers. Supplies.";
