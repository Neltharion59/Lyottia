We bump into them on our patrols from time to time, but they don't lose too many words for us. It's some sort of feud with Thordorzelianos from a century or too ago. No inhabitants of the Village of Heroes are old enough to remember, although I guess that the most dwarves are. Say, we have our own troubles, too. This slope here happens to be nested by a powerful harpy witch. She has just laid eggs. They'e not just regular harpy eggs, you see. They bear special markings, meaning that young harpy queens are going to hatch from them. We've been sent here to destroy them, but upon our arrival, we realized that she's too powerful for us. Would you perhaps be willing to take her down? Don't try to break those eggs, they're warded by powerful magic. We know how to handle that. Wr just need the witch out of our way. You're welcome to keep any treasures you can find on her.";
