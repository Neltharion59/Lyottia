I intended to find myself a lonely place where I could meditate on secrets of magic and practice spellcasting. Not long after I left the town, this krug band started following me. After two days, I found this cave. Before I departed, I had bought cheap scrolls of raising golems in town to protect myself. With my deepest energy reserves I raised a few golems to protect me. They were pretty weak for obsidian golems and soon stopped following my orders, but they intimidated the krug enough to stop them from entering the cave. With golems out of control, however, I remained trapped here until you arrived. Next time, I won't be fooled by tempting discounts. I really, really thank you, stranger.";
