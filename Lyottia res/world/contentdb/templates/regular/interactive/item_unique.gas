Everyone believed the story of bandits killing her during robbery, except for her husband. Anvozahr was an inventive man who loved his wife more than anything in the world. He quickly discovered Deamenos' name and methods. He also heard of his great skill and realized he could not defeat him in a fight. So he made a plan, crafted a magical helmet and wore it. He walked to royal court and called the queen 'Fat cow' in front of all the nobles. He walked out unharmed, but Deamenos was soon called to action. He followed Anvozahr into a dark silent street, strang his bow and fired an arrow. As soon as his arrow hit Anvozahr's helmet, an energy nova launched at his assassin. A moment later, both men were laying dead on the ground.";
